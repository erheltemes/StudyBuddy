# StudyBuddy

## User Story
```
AS A student I WANT TO manage my upcoming study sessions and notes SO THAT I can easily set up times and locations with my peers.
```

## Description
Study Buddy is an app that allows a signed-in user to view their notes and upcoming study sessions from their dashboard. In the upcoming sessions page, they can view study sessions being hosted or add their own study session for people to sign up to attend.

## MVP
The MVP for this project was a site that allowed users to sign up, sign in, logout, view their sessions and notes, and view all sessions.
